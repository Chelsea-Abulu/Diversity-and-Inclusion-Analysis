# Diversity-and-Inclusion-Analysis

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze the diversity and inclusion metrics within the organization, focusing on employee demographics, hiring trends, promotions, performance ratings, job types, and turnover rates. The aim is to provide insights that will help the organization foster a more inclusive and equitable workplace.

**Data Source:** The dataset used for this analysis was collected from internal HR records provided by PWC company.

**Tool Used:** Power BI 

**Data Cleaning:**
The dataset was carefully cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, renaming columns for clarity, and standardizing data formats to ensure consistency across all records.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
The EDA focused on answering the following key questions:
- What is the total number of current employees?
- How many employees left the organization in the past year?
- What are the demographics of new hires, particularly by gender and age?
- How many employees were promoted, and what is the gender breakdown of those promotions?
- How do performance ratings differ by gender?
- What is the distribution of employees by job type (full-time vs. contract)?
- What is the overall turnover rate, and what does it indicate about the organization's retention strategies?

### **Key Insights:**
- **Total Employees:** The organization currently has a workforce of 500 employees, consisting of 295 men and 205 women. Over the past year, 47 employees have left the company.
- **New Hires:** Women made up 51.5% of the new hires, while men accounted for 48.5%. Notably, more younger women were hired in the age ranges of 20-29 and 40-49, whereas men were predominantly hired in the 30-39 and 50-69 age brackets.
- **Promotions:** A total of 10.2% of the employees were promoted, with men representing 6.6% and women 3.6%. This suggests a potential disparity in promotion opportunities between genders.
- **Performance Ratings:** Men received consistently higher performance ratings than women, suggesting the possibility of an imbalance or bias in the evaluation process.
- **Job Type:** Among full-time staff, 293 were men and 172 were women. In contrast, contract staff included 2 men and 33 women, indicating a clear gender inequality in terms of job security and job type.
- **Turnover Rate:** The turnover rate stands at 86.8%, which raises concerns about employee retention and suggests that the organization may need to strengthen its retention strategies.

### Recommendations:
1. **Promotion Equity:** Implement clear and transparent criteria for promotions to ensure that all employees, regardless of gender, have equal opportunities for advancement.
2. **Performance Evaluation:** Review and revise the performance evaluation process to identify and eliminate any potential biases that could unfairly impact specific groups.
3. **Job Security:** Address the disparity in job types by providing more opportunities for women to transition from contract to full-time positions.
4. **Retention Strategies:** Develop targeted retention strategies, particularly for groups with higher turnover rates, such as offering competitive compensation packages and benefit packages like healthcare and retirement plans. Additionally, conduct regular exit interviews to understand the reasons behind departures and adjust policies accordingly to improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.
5. **Diversity Training:** Conduct regular diversity and inclusion training for all staff to promote a more inclusive work environment and raise awareness of unconscious biases.


### Conclusion:
The analysis reveals several areas of concern regarding diversity and inclusion within the organization. While there is a relatively balanced gender distribution among new hires, the disparity in promotions, performance ratings, and job types indicates potential challenges in achieving true equity in the workplace. The high turnover rate further emphasizes the need for the organization to evaluate its current policies and practices to ensure they support long-term employee retention and satisfaction.
Addressing these issues is crucial for fostering a more inclusive and sustainable work environment.
